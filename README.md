# Caesar Cipher

Day 7 project from "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu

A Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique used to encode messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions.
Each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter a certain number of positions down the alphabet.
The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
